## Routing and Navigation

The Routing and Navigation aspect of the Licensing Application Frontend is crucial for providing users with a seamless and intuitive experience as they navigate through different views and sections of the application. This section outlines the utilization of the react-router-dom library for routing and navigation, including how routes are configured, the purpose of each route, and how navigation is enhanced.

### Routes Configuration

The application uses the `react-router-dom` library to define and manage routes. The `Routes` and `Route` components are used to set up the routing structure. Each route corresponds to a specific view or page within the application.

```jsx
import { Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";

function App() {
  return (
    <Routes>
      <Route
        path="/"
        element={<Desktop9 formData={formData} setFormData={setFormData} />}
      />
      <Route
        path="/license-type"
        element={<Desktop10 formData={formData} setFormData={setFormData} />}
      />
      {/* ... other routes */}
    </Routes>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Purpose of Each Route

- **Root Route ("/"):** Serves as the entry point of the application. It directs users to the `Desktop9` component, where customer information is collected.
- **License Type Route ("/license-type"):** Users select the type of license for the software product on this route (`Desktop10` component).
- **License Details Route ("/license-details"):** Users input additional details required for generating the license on this route (`Desktop11` component).
- **Preview Route ("/preview"):** Provides a preview of the provided license information (`Desktop12` component).
- **Selected Modules Route ("/selected-modules"):** Users can review and confirm the selected modules for the license on this route (`Desktop15` component).
- **Module Selector Route ("/module-selector"):** Users can customize the modules included in the license on this route (`Desktop14` component).
- **Decrypt Route ("/decrypt"):** Users can decrypt their encrypted license keys on this route (`Decrypt` component).
- **History Route ("/history"):** Users can view their historical license data on this route (`History` component).

## State Handling

State handling within the Licensing Application Frontend is critical for managing user input and dynamic data throughout the application. This section outlines the implementation of state management using the `useState` hook and demonstrates how the state is initialized, updated, and shared between components.

### Initialization

The state within the application is managed using the `useState` hook from the React library. This hook allows for the creation of local component state. In the `App` component, the `formData` state is initialized to manage various user inputs and dynamic data associated with the licensing process.

```jsx
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
  id: uuidv4(),
  name: "",
  email: "",
  // ... other fields
});
```

The `formData` state object captures a range of user input fields, including customer details, license information, selected modules, and additional comments.

### Sharing State Between Components

The `formData` state is shared between components using the concept of "props drilling." Each component that requires access to the state receives it as a prop, allowing them to read and update the data.

For example, in the `App` component, the `formData` state and the `setFormData` function are passed down to each route's component using the `element` prop:

```jsx
<Routes>
  <Route
    path="/"
    element={<Desktop9 formData={formData} setFormData={setFormData} />}
  />
  {/* ... other routes */}
</Routes>
```

Within each route's component (e.g., `Desktop9`, `Desktop10`, etc.), the `formData` state can be accessed and updated using the provided props.

### Dynamic Updates

As the user interacts with the application and provides input, the `setFormData` function is used to update the state dynamically. For instance, when a user types into an input field, a corresponding `setFormData` call updates the relevant key in the `formData` state.

```jsx
const handleNameChange = (event) => {
  setFormData({
    ...formData,
    name: event.target.value,
  });
};
```

## Mock API and JavaScript

This Node.js application built with Express serves as a web server for handling encryption, decryption, and license data management in a MongoDB database. It imports essential modules, including Express for web server functionality, CryptoJS for encryption and decryption, Mongoose for MongoDB interactions, and others. The

server is configured to run on port 3002.

The application features several endpoints:

- **Encryption Endpoint (/encrypt):** Accepts data and encrypts it using CryptoJS with a secret key, returning the encrypted data in JSON format.
- **Decryption Endpoint (/decrypt):** Users can submit encrypted data along with a password for decryption. The server attempts decryption and responds with the decrypted data or an error if decryption fails.
- **License Management Endpoint (/api/licenses):** Allows users to submit license details, including timestamp, description, encryptedLicense, and name. The server saves the data and responds with a success message.
- **History Endpoint (/history):** Retrieves all stored licenses from the database and returns them as a JSON response.

## Styling Guidelines

Styling methodologies include:

- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility classes streamline styling.
- **Material-UI:** Offers pre-designed components adhering to Material Design principles.
- Consistent UI patterns ensure a cohesive user experience.
- Carefully chosen color palette and typography enhance aesthetics.
