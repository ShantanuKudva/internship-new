# Licensing Application Frontend Development Project Overview

## Project Overview

The "Licensing Application Frontend Development" project aims to create a fully functional licensing interface with seamless API integration using mock API calls and JavaScript simulations. The application will capture and display relevant customer and license information. The project timeframe is one month, with regular progress updates and milestone achievements provided on a weekly or twice-a-week basis.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to develop a user-friendly and visually appealing licensing application frontend that enables users to generate licenses for various purposes. The application will collect customer details, license validity information, module preferences, license types, and additional comments. By integrating mock API calls and JavaScript simulations, the frontend will simulate interactions with the backend for license generation, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Project Requirements

### Technology Considerations

- Utilize Figma for UI/UX design purposes.
- Use Locofy to automate frontend code generation based on Figma designs.
- Utilize MongoDB for persistence.
- Implement mock API endpoints using MirageJS or JSON Server for simulating backend interactions.

### Deliverables

- Develop a fully functional licensing application frontend.
- Integrate mock API calls for simulating communication with the backend.
- Create JavaScript simulations for backend logic related to license generation.
- Provide comprehensive documentation on frontend architecture, mock API endpoints, and usage instructions.
- Include code comments throughout the codebase for better understanding and future development.

### UI/UX Development

- Prototype the frontend UI/UX using Figma for a visually appealing and user-friendly design.
- Ensure the design aligns with data capture requirements and provides easy navigation.

### Frontend Development

- Design an intuitive and responsive user interface using React.
- Implement form elements to capture essential customer details and license information.
- Perform client-side validation to ensure data accuracy before submitting to the mock API.
- Integrate mock API calls for license generation and simulate backend communication.
- Implement error handling for API responses, displaying user-friendly messages for various scenarios.
- Ensure the frontend application is optimized for different devices and screen sizes.

### Mock API and JavaScript

- Create mock API endpoints using MirageJS or JSON Server to simulate backend interactions.
- Define mock API responses for successful license generation and error scenarios.
- Utilize Axios or Fetch API to interact with mock API endpoints from the frontend.
- Simulate backend logic for license generation using JavaScript functions.
- Store successful license generations as MongoDB records.
- Implement a UI to display the list of all historically generated licenses.
